Hello everyone, my name is Nilton, work in IT over 10 years and as Infrastructure Analyst almost 8, I am a lover of technology and Linux, even before the commercial Internet in Brazil I've loved it all.


I have much affinity with Linux System and Opensource applications, know and administer Linux environments since 1999.

Most of the time working with Infrastructure, in 90% Linux environment and 100% virtualized using Xen Hypervisor with XenServer from Citrix.

Develop love, I learned the hard way code in Perl, PHP, Python, golang, but before learning these languages started making small scripts in Bash.

I started in the world using Linux Slackware and then went to Mandrake Desktop with KDE, shortly after I met Carlos Morimoto with Kurumin system Linux and its generally fantastic scripts, that's when I started to read and try to understand what those scripts did.

With that came my curiosity with programming, then immediately I got curious with Perl because it is the closest language of Bash.

Meanwhile I attended much of Kurumin project in forums, helping with scripts and when Kurumin was dying, I helped a little Kurunin-NG Project, there I was meeting a wonderful language called Python.

But that did not kill my yields for knowledge in the Linux world, I took several courses in the area, from development of Web pages, HTML and Javascript to Photoshop, Fireworks and Dreamweaver, video editing and animation.
Also I am fanatic for Hardware and Networking, did some courses Networks, Hardware and Electronic.

But before all this and enter the IT world, I made various other cool things, such as: Gymnastics Olympic Animation Drawing, Drawing comics and played around with photograph.

I've always been a person in love with reading, Video Games games and everything is new, I'm very Geek.

Today I am a power user and administrator Senior Unix Like systems, administer environment with various Distros, they are: Debian, OpenSUSE, CentOS, Ubuntu and others.

Participate in various OpenSource projects, they are: XenServer, Samba4, ISPConfig3, NagiosQL. With documentation, translation, scripts, tips and stuff.
